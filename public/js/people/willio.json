    "name": "Deseme Willio",
    "bio": "From Cite Soleil, Willio loves connection and interaction with people. He thrives on community, and sees the value in building community by joking and being close with people. Motivated and intelligent, when he is not at the iLab, Willio can be found working with kids or studying for his Masters in Community, Applied Change, Conservation and Peace Building at the Future Generation Graduate School. Willio thinks iLab//Haiti is the best thing to happen to Haiti to push it into the new century. He sees it as a system of development to develop Haiti more quickly, that it's about not telling Haitians what to do but showing Haitians what to do.",
