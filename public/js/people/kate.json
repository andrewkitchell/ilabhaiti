    "name": "Kate Gamin",
    "bio": "Kate Ganim attended Brown University with a BA in Psychology. Ever seeking a balance between working in the creative and in the technical, Kate made the move to San Francisco to attend the California College of the Arts for a Masters in Architecture, which she completed in 2012. While attending CCA, she co-founded a construction company focusing on public works projects and small scale development. Her thesis, “Immersive Learning Landscapes,” explored ways in which the school building could better serve progressive, whole child, education. <br><br> Kate believes that the design framework can be broadly applied to critical thinking and creative problem solving. She loves dreaming up ideas, figuring out how to bring them into reality, and making it happen.",
