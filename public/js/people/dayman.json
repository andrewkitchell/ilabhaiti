    "name": "Dayman Cash",
    "bio": "Why adhere to seeing something that everyone else see's the same way? The non-conformist nature of Dayman's life tends to follow him into his film making and still photography adventures. <br><br>Perspective, with a splash of perspective can tell the eyes a completely different story of even the most ordinary of subjects. <br><br>His passion for creating inspiring pieces of work keep him rolling in the dirt and risking life and limb to convey a vision of a moment in this ephemeral world we consume. <br><br>Dayman has a background in software development and types relentlessly to make things go boom during the waking hours of most, but avidly longs and marvels in the outlets he receives in the arts.",
